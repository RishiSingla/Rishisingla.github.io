<p>This is a 3.5L V6 engine.</p>

<p>This is the Dual VVT 2.4L V4 engine. This is a really hard engine to find in the 2009 Dodge journey because they didn't produce a lot of V4 engine and this engine is in the SE not the SXT.</p>

<p>The Honda CR-V engine.</p>

<h5>Which one is better?</h5>
<p>Since we know about the horse power each engine hold's, a depth tour about the 2 car's and the spec's, it is time to make a decesion on which one is better the 2009 Dodge Journey sxt suv crossover or the Honda CR-V. The good points on buying the car</p>
<h6>The CR-V good points</h6>
<ol>
<li>Affordable</li>
<li>Compact</li>
<li>166 horsepower</li>
<li>5 seater</li>
<li>Front wheel drive</li>
<li>4 cylinder</li>
<li>2.4 liter engine</li>
<li>20 miles with full gas tank in the city</li>
<li>26-27 miles with full tank on the highway</li>
</ol>
<h7>The Journey good points</h7>
<ol>
<li>Affordable</li>
<li>Compact</li>
<li>173-235 horse power</li>
<li>5-7 seater</li>
<li>Front wheel-all wheel drive</li>
<li>4-6 cylinder</li>
<li>2.4 Liter-3.5 Liter engine</li>
<li>15-19 miles with full gas tank in the city</li>
<li>21-25 miles with full tank on the highway</li>
</ol>
<h8>Decesion time</h8>
<p>I would say the Dodge journey is better because it has more horsepower, seating space, it is front and all wheel drive, and it has more cylinder's meaning even more horsepower. On the other hand the CR-V has better milage in the city and highway meaning you won't have to fill your gas tank up as often as you have to in the Journey and you will pay less for gas because of the 2.4L engine.</p>
<p>The Dodge journey is better over all but the Honda CR-V is better because it cost's less overall in buying and gas cost.
I will go with the Dodge because it has more seating space but most people will go with the CR-V because of the cost.</p>
<p>Therefore the Honda CR-V is better because of the cost.</p>
